h1. HtmlSharp

HtmlSharp is a C# library for parsing HTML.

h2. Usage

Let's say you have the following html stored in a string named html.

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html>
<head>
  <title>Sample HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="important">Make sure you read this part.</p>
  <p>Some info about stuff.</p>
  <p id="copyright">Copyright data.</p>
</body>
</html>
</pre>

The first step is to parse your document

  HtmlParser parser = new HtmlParser();
  HtmlDocument doc = parser.Parse(html);

From there, we can use "css selectors":http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors to find the information we want from the document.

To find the tag with the id of copyright, we can simply do:

  Tag t = doc.Find("#copyright");
