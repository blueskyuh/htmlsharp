h1. HtmlSharp

HtmlSharp is a C# library for parsing HTML that allows querying of the DOM with css selectors.

h2. Usage

Let's say you have the following html stored in a string named html.

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html>
<head>
  <title>Sample HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="important">Make sure you read this part.</p>
  <p>Some info about stuff.</p>
  <p align="left" id="copyright">Copyright data.</p>
</body>
</html>
</pre>

To be able to query this document, we'll need to parse it:

  HtmlParser parser = new HtmlParser();
  HtmlDocument doc = parser.Parse(html);

From there, we can use "css selectors":http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors to find the information we want from the document.

Finding the tag with the id of copyright:

  Tag t = doc.Find("#copyright");

Automatic casting to access attributes statically:

  P paragraph = doc.Find<P>("#copyright");
  string align = paragraph.Align; // "left"
  string class = paragraph.Class; // null

Finding multiple tags:

  IEnumerable<Tag> paragraphs = doc.FindAll("p"); // Returns the 3 paragraph objects it finds
